# Myocardium morphology lane

Status: diagnostic lane; Phase M1 current-main residual blocker classification recorded
Scope: PV-loop and waveform morphology diagnostics; no runtime replacement authority

## Purpose

The morphology lane owns PV-loop and waveform evidence. It measures what the
user sees and classifies likely artifact sources. It makes no official
morphology pass claim and no runtime replacement claim; no-alternans remains
outside this lane.

This separation exists to prevent PV-loop appearance problems from being pushed into Land parameters or myocardial source-stress decisions.

## Owned artifacts

The morphology lane owns or coordinates:

```text
pv-loop-morphology-quality
filling-limb-artifact-audit
filling-limb-correlation-readiness
filling-limb-diagnostic-comparator
arterial-load-morphology
arterial-load-zc-reflection-comparator
PV-loop debug overlay
valve/qDot/clamp marker exports
```

## Outputs to the myocardium lane

Morphology produces evidence packages, not acceptance conclusions.

Required handoff fields:

```text
caseId
branchId
chamber
phaseLabel
metricId
metricValue
comparisonTarget
confidence
suspectedLane
claimBoundary

artifactPaths
```

## Result classes

### BLOCKER

Morphology evidence makes a myocardium interpretation unsafe.

Examples:

- qDot/valve event windows dominate a reported low-preload branch;
- pressure floor or clamp use coincides with an apparent morphology improvement;
- raw vs resampled metrics reverse a candidate ranking.

### ADVISORY

Morphology issue is present but does not block the current myocardium claim.

Examples:

- mild ejection-limb squareness with no effect on source-stress or solver-readiness claims;
- PV-loop display issue isolated to resampling or overlay only.

### OUT-OF-SCOPE-FOR-MYOCARDIUM

The issue belongs to another lane and should not be fitted away by myocardium parameters.

Examples:

- aortic-root/Zc/reflection signal gap;
- valve closure/incisura morphology;
- atrial bridge roughness contaminating filling.

## Not owned by this lane

Morphology lane must not claim or change:

- Land equation correctness;
- source stress scale acceptance;
- myocardial homogenization acceptance;
- no runtime replacement;
- official case acceptance;
- no final no-alternans;
- qDot/valve/afterload fixes;
- parameter tuning as a hidden morphology fix.

## Status

Per-run blocker and advisory classifications live in the pull request and report
that produced them, not in this document. The lane frontier is whatever the
latest morphology run and owner visual review say.

Standing constraint: disease profiles stay report-only until a normal baseline
passes strict morphology and owner review.

## Handoff rule

Morphology can block myocardium interpretation, but it cannot make myocardium claims pass. A myocardium result becomes accepted only when the required myocardium gate also passes.
