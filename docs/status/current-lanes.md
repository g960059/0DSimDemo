# Current development lanes

Status: proposed coordination note
Scope: coordination only; no runtime/model claim

## Purpose

Track what each active team lane owns, what it may claim, what is blocked, and what the next experiment should be.

## Lane table

| Lane | Current state | Current blocker | Next experiment | Must not claim |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| myocardium | Phase 5C-H ModelCore-equivalent positive-control closure route recorded as defined-not-satisfied | same-closure legacy activeStress positive control settles to period-1 | ModelCore-equivalent positive-control closure experiment/evidence | no Land no-alternans acceptance, no runtime replacement, no official morphology pass |
| morphology | PV-loop diagnostics plus diagnostic E/A-like inflow proxy exist; current-main baseline snapshot remains historical | filling comparator retains residual E/A-like missingness in dobutamine RV groups; arterial Zc/reflection remains signal-gap limited | classify residual dobutamine RV E/A missingness; isolated arterial bench | no root-cause acceptance, no fix acceptance, no official morphology pass |
| atrial bridge | Phase 5.5 shootout plan exists | no shootout runner/candidate results yet | E0/A0/A1 shootout runner | final atrial physiology, AF validation |
| arterial load | Zc/reflection comparator readiness exists | no isolated bench or direct Zc/reflection signal | isolated arterial bench | production/default Zc adoption |
| studio/product | AI-native physiology studio direction proposed | MVP scope can grow too large | Home + Cases + static/mock Workbench | model validation, scientific acceptance |

## Weekly sync questions

1. Did any lane produce a BLOCKER for another lane?
2. Did any PR strengthen a claim boundary without evidence?
3. Is the next step an experiment or another readiness document?
4. Are we using morphology evidence to tune myocardium parameters? If yes, stop.
5. Are we using myocardium progress to claim product/clinical validity? If yes, stop.

## Current top priorities

1. Produce evidence for the Phase 5C ModelCore-equivalent positive-control closure route or replace the Phase 5C positive-control requirement.
2. Classify residual dobutamine RV E/A-like missingness after the diagnostic inflow proxy.
3. Define/run an isolated arterial bench.
4. Keep morphology evidence diagnostic-only when feeding myocardium decisions.
5. Keep studio MVP narrow and separate from scientific acceptance.
